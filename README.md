# Warehouse Order Fulfillment Simulation

This project simulates the order fulfillment process in a warehouse using discrete-event simulation. It analyzes *worker utilization*, *queue lengths*, *processing times*, *and system bottlenecks*.

## Project Goals
- Simulate warehouse order processing with variable arrivals
- Measure system performance under different staffing levels
- Visualize average wait time, queue lengths, and resource utilization

## Tools Used
- Python
- SimPy (discrete-event simulation)
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Git + GitHub for version control
